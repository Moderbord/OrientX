## Picking up where we left off

This project was created as an assignment for LTU:s Bachelor Programme in Computer Engineering, year 1.  
It was the first experience we had with Dart + Flutter.  
Some of the files could be structured better, and it's not unlikely to be badly optimized.  
Flutter is difficult to comment, but we've tried our best to document our code.

### Dependencies
Dependencies are listed in the PUBSPEC file as per Flutter standards.  
All plugins should be available on the Flutter plugin repository.

### Background Geolocation
BGG is a premium plugin and will only work in debug mode until licensed.  
See the plugin's website or Flutter plugin store page for more information regarding licensing.

### Firebase
The app uses Firebase for authentication and storage. While the database we set up is unlikely to be usable,  
we've included what is needed to setup a new one. See the included PDF (protocol.pdf) for more details  
regarding the communication protocols.
